I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Translation Studies and I've worked as a technical English-Portuguese translator for 10 years. After working with natural languages for so long, a couple of years ago, I discovered that my true passion is actually _programming_ languages.

After building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS/SCSS and vanilla JavaScript, for the past year, I've been intensively self-learning TypeScript, React, Node and other technologies related to the JavaScript ecosystem. I have just recently fallen in love with Elixir and have started learning it as well.

My goal and dream is to work full time as a full-stack developer. I'm currently looking for an entry-level opportunity, either paid or unpaid, remote or in-office.
