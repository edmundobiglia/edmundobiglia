I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Translation Studies and I've worked as a technical English-Portuguese translator for 10 years. After working with natural languages for so long, a couple of years ago, I discovered that my true passion was actually _programming_ languages.

After building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS/SCSS and vanilla JavaScript, in the past year, I've been intensively self-learning TypeScript, React, Node and all the ecosystem of related technologies with the goal and dream of working full time as a full-stack developer.

Despite not having formal work experience as a developer, I've been working on personal projects to practice my skills in React, Redux, React Router, Styled Components, Express, RESTful APIs, SQL and NoSQL databases, TypeORM, Firebase, among other technologies.

I'm currently looking for an entry-level opportunity, either paid or unpaid, remote or in-office.
