I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Translation Studies and I have worked as a technical English-Portuguese translator since 2008. After working with natural languages for so long, a couple of years ago, I discovered my true passion was actually 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 languages.

I am currently learning JavaScript, Nodejs, Reactjs, React Native and all of the JS ecosystem with the goal and dream of becoming a full-time full-stack JavaScript developer.
