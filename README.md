I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Translation Studies and I have worked as a technical English-Portuguese translator since 2008. After working with natural languages for a long time, a couple of years ago, I discovered that my true passion was actually _programming_ languages.

I am currently learning JavaScript/TypeScript, Nodejs, Reactjs, React Native and all of the JS ecosystem with the goal and dream of becoming a full-time full-stack JavaScript developer.
